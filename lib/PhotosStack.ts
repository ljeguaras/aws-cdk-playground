    //The construct ID is a name you assign in code when you create a resource.
    // CDK uses this construct ID (plus a hash for uniqueness) to generate the logical ID, which CloudFormation uses in the template.
    // The logical ID is composed of the construct ID followed by a short hash.
    // It is used by AWS CloudFormation to identify resources uniquely within the stack.
    // For example: PhotosBucket â†’ PhotosBucket2FjdsfoQwe


   //The difference between a logical ID and a physical ID is that the logical ID is required and used by AWS CloudFormation to reference resources within the template, while the physical ID is required by AWS as a globally unique identifier, similar to an ARN (Amazon Resource Name)."

    // | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
    // | Construct ID | Your CDK code  | Identifies the construct in the CDK app                 |
    // | Logical ID   | CloudFormation | Identifies the resource in the CloudFormation stack     |
    // | Physical ID  | AWS Resource   | Globally unique (like the S3 bucket name or Lambda ARN) |
